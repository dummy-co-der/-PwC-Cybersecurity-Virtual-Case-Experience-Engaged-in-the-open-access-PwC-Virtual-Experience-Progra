# PwC-Cybersecurity-Virtual-Case-Experience
Engaged in the open-access PwC Virtual Experience Program with Forage creating a risk assessment presentation. Tasks Completed include: Integrated Information Defense, Risk Assessment, IT System Security Baseline, Network Segmentation

## Task 3: IT System Security Baseline <br>
### Background
After analysing the impact of possible risks at Boldi AG, it’s time to determine how we can lower the likelihood of these risks through specific cybersecurity measures. We need to prevent these risks from occurring by decreasing each IT system’s threat surface and thus decreasing the total threat surface of Boldi AG.

Stefan has met with the Head of IT Infrastructure at Boldi AG to discuss the measures required to follow up on the risk assessment. He acknowledged the need for a detailed vulnerability review as this has not been performed for several years. However, he is not convinced that maintaining an up-to-date Information Systems Security Baseline is worth the effort since the system can be scanned with a vulnerability scan anytime. We need to convince him and you'll help Stefan to create some graphics to do so.

### Directive
First, you need to learn more about

* Vulnerability Assessment
* Mitigation Planning
* Vulnerability Scanning
* Hardware and Systems Security
* Information Systems Security Baseline
and why an up-to-date Information System Security Baseline is crucial. 

Use your new knowledge to create a graphic using the terms, so we can present it to the Head of IT Infrastructure. 

Write notes below your graphic, explaining in your own words the relationship between the terms.

This experience is self-paced. However, Stefan is meeting the Head of IT Infrastructure at Boldi AG in 1 hour again and need your great figure to convince him. We recommend you spend no more than that completing this task.
