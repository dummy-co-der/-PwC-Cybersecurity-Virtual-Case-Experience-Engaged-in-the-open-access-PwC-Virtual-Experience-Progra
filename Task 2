# PwC-Cybersecurity-Virtual-Case-Experience
Engaged in the open-access PwC Virtual Experience Program with Forage creating a risk assessment presentation. Tasks Completed include: Integrated Information Defense, Risk Assessment, IT System Security Baseline, Network Segmentation

## Task 2: Risk Assessment
### Background
Our Cybersecurity team gave an excellent presentation. We won the pitch! Now the action starts: Stefan needs to present a risk assessment of Boldi AG to its management, explaining it in detail step by step. But a risk assessment requires lots of work up front.   

You are working with Stefan on location at Boldi to learn as much as possible about the company. First, it is critical to establish a common understanding of information risk at Boldi AG. This means learning about the company and its culture.

What is their risk tolerance?
How willing are they to accept risk?
How do they handle changes in processes and systems?
A risk management framework can provide top-down guidance and establish the attitude and mindset to build consensus about risk. It is also important to understand how Boldi AG controls changes in business processes and systems, particularly Information Technology Systems.

### Directive
Create and submit a PowerPoint slide deck for Stefan answering step 2 and 3. For the first step, use the memo function of your phone and upload a voicemail to complete your task.

1. To learn more about Boldi AG and its culture, you first need to determine who you should talk to at Boldi AG and what the content of these interviews should be. How does your agenda differ based on the audience, e.g. management vs. engineers? Stefan is currently in a meeting, leave him a voicemail (no longer than 1.5 minutes).

2. Now you are prepared to conduct an information risk impact assessment. In the meantime, you discover that Boldi AG files on paper and the companyâ€™s cloud-based information systems are inconsistent in format and hard to use for an analysis. Plus, there are no controls over who in the company can access these files. 

Does any of this present an information security concern? Please explain your answer in the slide deck. Think of this through the prism of confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) and add slides to your started presentation.

3. After you know enough about Boldi AG, decide what type of risk assessment would be best, a quantitative risk assessment or a qualitative risk assessment. Then explain the difference between quantitative and qualitative assessments. What do you rely on to be able to perform a quantitative assessment? Which method could be more adapted for information security risk assessments? 

This experience is self-paced. However, you and Stefan have a presentation to Boldi AG management with your findings in 1 hour. We recommend you spend no more than that completing this task.

### Presentation
**Voicemail**: *"Good day, Stefan. In relation to the risk assessment you'll be presenting on, I'm reaching out to learn more about Boldi AG and its culture. I wanted to learn more about the organisation so that Boldi AG and I could have a shared understanding of information risk. I was hoping to meet with the company's executives and engineers. Learning more about the organisation and the processes of each department are among the questions I'd like to ask management.I'd like each manager to speak briefly about their security concerns, as well as what they consider to be the most vital products and services to safeguard. I'd like to hear what the critical applications are for the engineers and IT department. I'd like to know how they document their changes to the system and network, as well as how they stay up to date with industry standards. Finally, I'd like to do some tabletop exercises to see how they handle cyber attacks. Please call me back so that we may begin and complete a thorough risk management framework evaluation for Boldi AG."*
